# Student Grade Table

This project is a web/mobile application that implements all of the CRUD (Create, Read, Update Delete) functionalities. The application is for teachers to keep track of their students and their respective grades. It is an easy-to-use content management type of application that was built with HTML5 and Bootstrap CSS for responsiveness on the frontend. On the backend, PHP endpoints were created and all of the student data is in a MySQL database.

## Technologies Used
HTML5, BootStrap, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL

## Features
> Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
> The ability for users to create students, edit student information, and delete
> Validation so that users cannot input just any random data into the input fields

## Future Features
> Filter or a search bar for teachers to find a certain student rapidly
> Pagination with 20-50 entries per page
> Implementing a Login Feature

## Other
> The Student Grade Table is the first application I built that utilized both the front end and backend technologies. At first, the application was utilizing data through an api that was connected to someone else's server. After learning about databases and endpoints and how to connect each other, I was able to implement for the first time all of the CRUD features.
